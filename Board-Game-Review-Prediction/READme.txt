In this project, a dataset of about 82000 rows and 20 columns was given regarding the reviews of various board games available. A supervised machine learning model as then been trained and evaluated to predict the ratings given to a particular board game based on several features of the datasets.

In order to choose the machine learning algorithms best suited to make predictions of the average rating of the board games, number of regression or similar models were considered and the data has been investigated to choose the best possible models:

Considering that the problem is to predict a numerical value several options such as follows could be chosen:

Linear Regression: Can be chosen if the variables show a linear correlation with the label. If the correlation is not linear, the linear regression model would not be accurate.
